Randomly choose the subject Dagon type. For example: a humanoid fish creature with scales and fins. Dagon was an ancient northwest Semitic god worshiped by the early Amorites and by the people of Ebla and Ugarit. He was also a major god, perhaps the chief god, of the biblical Philistines. He was primarily associated with fertility, including abundant crop harvests, but also dealt with anointing kings and leaders.
Choose an age-range. For example: young adult.
Choose one to two classes for the subject. For example: rogue and bard. These are classes from Dungeons & Dragons, a popular role-playing game that features fantasy races and creatures.
Choose one to two accessories for the subject. For example: a hat and a necklace. Accessories can add personality and flair to the subject, as well as hint at their backstory or interests.
Choose one to two colors for the subject’s outfit. For example: black and red. Colors can convey mood and emotion, as well as contrast or complement the subject’s skin tone.
Using your imagination and creativity, describe the Dagon’s unique features and physique. For example: The Dagon has a slender and agile body, with a long tail that ends in a fan-like fin. His skin is slimy and shiny, with a gradient of blue colors from dark to light. He has orange eyes that glow in the dark, and a row of sharp teeth that he flashes in a mischievous grin. He wears a black leather vest and pants that are adorned with various trinkets and charms. He also carries a lute on his back and a dagger on his belt. He has a red hat on his head that matches his necklace, which has a pendant shaped like a fish.
Choose an emotion or attitude for the subject to express. For example: confident and playful. Emotions and attitudes can make the subject more relatable and engaging, as well as show their personality and character.
Pick an action or pose for the Dagon to perform that is expressive of its random nature and emotion or attitude. For example: The Dagon leaps into the air, twisting his body in a graceful arc. He holds his lute in one hand and his dagger in the other, ready to strike a chord or an enemy. He looks at the camera with a confident and playful expression, as if inviting the viewer to join him in his adventure.
Choose an angle and perspective for the camera to capture the subject’s action or pose. For example: ultra low angle. Angles and perspectives can create different effects and impressions on the viewer, such as making the subject look more powerful or dynamic.
Select a time of day and a setting that enhances the whimsical nature of the Dagon, such as a magical forest or a colorful garden full of blooming flowers. Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique and interesting description, incorporating the elements from steps 1-9. For example: The scene is set at night, in a dark and mysterious forest. The only sources of light are the moon and the stars, which cast a soft glow on the Dagon and his surroundings. The trees are tall and twisted, with branches that form arches and tunnels. The ground is covered with moss and mushrooms, some of which emit a faint luminescence. The Dagon seems to blend in with the environment, as his scales reflect the colors of the night sky. He is surrounded by fireflies that create streaks of light as he moves through the air.
Choose one to two types of lighting for the scene that create drama and contrast for the subject’s action or pose. For example: rim light and volumetric light. Lighting can enhance the mood and atmosphere of the scene, as well as highlight or shadow certain parts of the subject.
Choose one to three art styles that influence the visual presentation of the scene. For example: post-post-modernism, superflat, outsider art style. Art styles can reflect different movements or trends in art history or culture, as well as express different aesthetics or messages.
Choose one to two types of texture for the brush strokes that create dynamism and depth for the scene. For example: dynamic brush texture. Texture can add variety and interest to the image, as well as suggest movement or realism. Dynamic brush texture can create a sense of energy and spontaneity, as well as contrast with the smoothness of the subject’s skin.
