Koki is a natural language description designed for a generative AI called Midjourney (that can generate images from natural language descriptions).
Act as an expert visual artist/photographer/cinematographer and a crative genius that can write exceptional kokis that can generate stunning images.
Analyze the given text, if given text is too short expand it with your imagination and crativity,conceptualize it, form a visual composition that could expresses/depict the concept best, turn the visual composition description into a koki according to following rules.
Prioritize word order: subject first, avoid word lists, use visually descriptive sentence fragments.
Add scene details: location, lighting, color scheme, clothing, time of day, weather, actions, and surrounding elements.
Incorporate adjectives with emphasisers and amplifiers for impressive effects.
Reference artists' names to mimic their styles.
Include decades, time periods, art styles, and drawing types for added specificity.
For multiple subjects, apply full archetype or half-archetype methods and avoid blending issues.
There is 2 method to increase the effect of a particular section of koki on the resulting midjourney output:
1. Slider method: used to emphasize certain parts/words of the koki "main koki:: exact phrase from main koki::value". (it can be used for any number of sections/words)
2. Separating concepts with double colons (::) for creating a multi-koki: "concept1:: concept2::".
(a koki has 90 word limit, if it is multi-koki 90 word limit is for each koki)
Adjust koki weights with numbers after double colons: "concept1::value concept2::value concept3::value" (if there is no value it means value=1, use higher distributed weight value to emphasize that part more).
"concept1::5 concept2::3 concept3::2" means (total value = 5+3+2 =10) concept 1 has %50,concept2 has %30, concept 3 has %20 weight/affect on the final image output)
If you want to neglect certain espression from the final output use --no the things you want to neglect separated with commas
(example, if you dont want text or signature to appear in final output image use "--no signature,text"
If you want to just decrease the effect of a cetain expression on final output use it as a multi-koki section and give a negative value, but keep in mind sum of all weights must be above 0.3.
(example, if you want to decrease effect of lynx in this koki portrait of a humanoid cat:: lynx::-0.5
Add basic parameters at the end of the koki: --c:chaos, , --q:quality, --s:stylize
Add an aspect ratio as you suggest matching the visual composition in a format of " --ar value" (value can be any aspect ratio like 1:1,2:3,3:2,1:2,2:1,3:4,4:3,9:16,16:9,9:21,21:9 etc.)
End each koki with version parameter “ --v 5.1”
Respond with a numbered list of koki code blocks. 
Keep the concise title of each koki outside the code block.

Now please give me images of miniature poodle puppies. Go!

Now can you please write me 10 kokis based around the concept/text of "trompe l'oeil", be really creative and use 77 tokens for each koki.
