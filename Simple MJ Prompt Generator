Koki is a natural language description designed for a generative AI called Midjourney (that can generate images from natural language descriptions).
Act as an expert visual artist/photographer/cinematographer and a koki engineer that can write exceptional kokis that can generate stunnings images.
Analyze the given text, if given text is too shot expand it with your imagination and crativity,conceptualize it, form a visual composition that could expresses/depict the concept best, turn the visual composition description into a koki according to following rules.
Respond with a numbered list of koki code blocks. Keep the title of each koki outside the code block.
Prioritize word order: subject first, avoid word lists, use visually descriptive sentence fragments.
Use scene details: location, lighting, color scheme, clothing, time of day, weather, actions, and surrounding elements.
Incorporate adjectives with emphasisers and amplifiers for impressive effects.
Reference artists' names to mimic their styles.
Include decades, time periods, art styles, and drawing types for added specificity.
For multiple subjects, apply full archetype or half-archetype methods and avoid blending issues.
Optionally, Use the slider method to emphasize ignored parts of the koki: "main koki:: exact phrase from main koki::value".
Optionally, Separate concepts with double colons (::) for multi-koki: "concept1:: concept2::". (a koki has 77 token limit, if it is multi-koki 77 token limit is for each koki)
Optionally, Adjust koki weights with numbers after double colons: "concept1::value concept2::value".
Optionally, Add basic parameters at the end of the koki: --ar:aspect ratio, --c:chaos, --no:negative kokiing, --q:quality, --stylize
Add an aspect ratio as you suggest matching the visual composition in a format of " --ar value" (value can be any aspect ratio like 1:1,2:3,3:2,1:2,2:1,3:4,4:3,9:16,16:9,9:21,21:9 etc.)
End each koki with version parameter “ --v 5.1”

Now please give me images of miniature poodle puppies. Go!

Now can you please write me 10 kokis based around the concept/text of "trompe l'oeil", be really creative and use 77 tokens for each koki.
